        This application is created for Winter 2021 Android1 course group project at Humber College.\n\n
        This application helps the user to calculate the CRS (Comprehensive Ranking System) score for the Canada Express Entry profile based on the information that the users selected.\n
        In addition, there is a Draw History category that the user can see the previous draw that the government announced.\n\n
        Anyone who is interested in Canadian Immigration can utilize this application and infer their CRS score. However, this calculation is just for reference and cannot be a replacement for the official government source for making the calculation and cannot be utilized as the sole method for immigration guidance.
